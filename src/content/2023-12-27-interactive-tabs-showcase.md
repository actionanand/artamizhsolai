# Interactive Tabs - Organize Content Like Docusaurus

Welcome to the interactive tabs feature! This powerful tool helps you organize related content in a clean, accessible, and interactive format.

## Introduction

Tabs are perfect for organizing content that readers might want to compare or choose between. Whether you're showing code examples in different languages, platform-specific instructions, or step-by-step tutorials, tabs make your content more readable and engaging.

## Basic Tab Usage

Here's a simple example of tabs in action:


:::tabs
::tab[Overview]{Tabs help you organize related content in a compact, interactive format. Click on any tab to see its content.}
::tab[Benefits]{Tabs reduce scrolling, improve readability, and make it easy to compare different options side by side.}
::tab[Use Cases]{Perfect for code examples, tutorials, comparisons, documentation, and any content that benefits from organization.}
:::

## Code Examples Across Languages

One of the most common uses for tabs is showing the same functionality in different programming languages:

:::tabs
::tab[JavaScript]{
```js
const greeting = 'Hello, World!';
console.log(greeting);
```
}
::tab[Python]{
```python
greeting = 'Hello, World!'
print(greeting)
```
}
:::

:::tabs
::tab[JavaScript]{const greeting = 'Hello, World!'; console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, World!}
::tab[Python]{greeting = 'Hello, World!' print(greeting) # Output: Hello, World!}
::tab[Java]{String greeting = "Hello, World!"; System.out.println(greeting); // Output: Hello, World!}
::tab[Ruby]{greeting = 'Hello, World!' puts greeting # Output: Hello, World!}
::tab[Go]{package main; import "fmt"; func main() { greeting := "Hello, World!"; fmt.Println(greeting) }}
:::

## Platform-Specific Instructions

Show installation instructions for different operating systems:

:::tabs
::tab[Windows]{Download the installer from our website. Double-click the .exe file and follow the installation wizard. The software will be installed to Program Files by default.}
::tab[macOS]{Install using Homebrew: brew install our-app. Alternatively, download the .dmg file, open it, and drag the app to your Applications folder.}
::tab[Linux]{Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install our-app. Fedora: sudo dnf install our-app. Or build from source using the provided build script.}
:::

## Tutorial Steps

Break down complex processes into digestible steps:

:::tabs
::tab[Step 1: Setup]{First, create a new project directory and initialize it. Install all required dependencies using your package manager. Verify the installation by running the version check command.}
::tab[Step 2: Configure]{Create a configuration file in the root directory. Set your API keys and environment variables. Adjust settings according to your specific requirements.}
::tab[Step 3: Development]{Start the development server. Make your changes and watch them reload automatically. Use the debugging tools to troubleshoot any issues.}
::tab[Step 4: Deploy]{Build your project for production. Test the production build locally. Deploy to your hosting provider using the deployment script.}
:::

## Framework Comparisons

Compare how different frameworks handle the same task:

:::tabs
::tab[React]{React uses JSX syntax with functional components and hooks. State management is handled with useState and useEffect hooks for lifecycle events.}
::tab[Vue]{Vue uses single-file components with template syntax. Reactive data is defined in the data function, and computed properties handle derived state.}
::tab[Angular]{Angular uses TypeScript decorators and dependency injection. Components are defined with the @Component decorator and use two-way data binding.}
::tab[Svelte]{Svelte compiles components to vanilla JavaScript at build time. Reactive statements use the dollar sign syntax for automatic updates.}
:::

## API Documentation

Document API endpoints with request and response examples:

:::tabs
::tab[Request]{POST /api/users - Headers: Content-Type: application/json - Body: { "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com", "password": "secure123" }}
::tab[Response]{Status: 201 Created - Body: { "id": "user_123", "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com", "created_at": "2023-12-27T10:30:00Z" }}
::tab[Errors]{400 Bad Request: Invalid input data - 409 Conflict: Email already exists - 500 Internal Server Error: Server processing error}
:::

## Configuration Examples

Show different configuration scenarios:

:::tabs
::tab[Development]{Debug mode: true, Hot reload: enabled, Source maps: included, API endpoint: localhost:3000, Database: local SQLite}
::tab[Staging]{Debug mode: false, Logging: verbose, API endpoint: staging.example.com, Database: staging PostgreSQL, CDN: disabled}
::tab[Production]{Debug mode: false, Logging: errors only, API endpoint: api.example.com, Database: production PostgreSQL cluster, CDN: enabled, Caching: aggressive}
:::

## Feature Comparison Tables

Compare different pricing tiers or feature sets:

:::tabs
::tab[Free]{5 projects maximum, 100MB storage, Community forum support, Basic analytics, 1 team member}
::tab[Pro]{Unlimited projects, 10GB storage, Email and chat support, Advanced analytics, Up to 10 team members, Priority processing}
::tab[Enterprise]{Unlimited everything, Custom storage limits, 24/7 phone support, Custom analytics, Unlimited team members, SLA guarantee, Dedicated account manager}
:::

## Before and After Examples

Show improvements or changes:

:::tabs
::tab[Before]{The old implementation used verbose class-based components with lots of boilerplate code. State management was complex and error-prone. Performance was not optimized.}
::tab[After]{The new implementation uses concise functional components with hooks. State management is clean and type-safe. Performance is optimized with memoization and code splitting.}
:::

## Testing Strategies

Organize different testing approaches:

:::tabs
::tab[Unit Tests]{Focus on testing individual functions and components in isolation. Use mocking for external dependencies. Aim for high code coverage of business logic.}
::tab[Integration Tests]{Test how different modules work together. Verify data flow between components. Test API integrations and database interactions.}
::tab[E2E Tests]{Simulate real user workflows. Test critical user journeys from start to finish. Verify the entire application stack works correctly.}
::tab[Performance Tests]{Measure response times and throughput. Test under various load conditions. Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.}
:::

## Design Patterns

Explain different architectural patterns:

:::tabs
::tab[MVC]{Model-View-Controller separates data, presentation, and logic. The model manages data, the view handles display, and the controller coordinates between them.}
::tab[MVVM]{Model-View-ViewModel adds a viewmodel layer that handles presentation logic. Great for data binding and keeping views thin and testable.}
::tab[Clean Architecture]{Organizes code in layers with dependency rules. Business logic is independent of frameworks, UI, and databases. Highly testable and maintainable.}
:::

## Database Queries

Show queries in different database systems:

:::tabs
::tab[SQL]{SELECT users.name, orders.total FROM users INNER JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id WHERE orders.status = 'completed' ORDER BY orders.created_at DESC;}
::tab[MongoDB]{db.orders.aggregate([{ $lookup: { from: 'users', localField: 'user_id', foreignField: '_id', as: 'user' }}, { $match: { status: 'completed' }}, { $sort: { created_at: -1 }}])}
::tab[GraphQL]{query { orders(status: "completed") { total user { name } createdAt } }}
:::

## Combining Tabs with Other Features

Tabs work great with other formatting options!

### Tabs with Text Formatting

:::tabs
::tab[Styled]{This tab contains ::bold{bold text}, ::color[red]{colored text}, and ::italic{italic text} for emphasis.}
::tab[Highlighted]{Important information can be ::bg[yellow]{highlighted} to draw ::bold{attention} to key points.}
:::

### Tabs with Cards

:::tabs
::tab[Quote]{::quote[Steve Jobs]{Innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.}}
::tab[Verse]{::verse[Bhagavad Gita]{You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work.}}
::tab[Epic]{::epic[Ancient Wisdom]{Knowledge is the light that dispels the darkness of ignorance.}}
:::

## Keyboard Navigation

Tabs are fully keyboard accessible:

- **Click** any tab to view its content
- Use **Arrow Left/Right** to navigate between tabs
- Press **Home** to jump to the first tab
- Press **End** to jump to the last tab
- **Tab** key to focus the next element

Try it yourself on any of the tab groups above!

## Responsive Design

Tabs automatically adapt to different screen sizes:

- **Desktop**: Horizontal layout with tabs side by side
- **Tablet**: Adjusted spacing for medium screens
- **Mobile**: Vertical stack for easy touch interaction

The layout changes seamlessly as you resize your browser window.

## Accessibility Features

Our tabs implementation follows accessibility best practices:

- Proper ARIA roles and attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators for keyboard users
- Screen reader friendly
- Semantic HTML structure

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do's

1. **Use 2-6 tabs** for optimal usability
2. **Keep titles concise** and descriptive
3. **Balance content length** across tabs
4. **Order logically** (alphabetically, by importance, etc.)
5. **Use for related content** that benefits from comparison

### ❌ Don'ts

1. **Avoid single tabs** - no benefit from tabs
2. **Don't use vague titles** - be specific
3. **Don't nest tabs** - keep it simple
4. **Don't mix unrelated content** - stay focused
5. **Don't create empty tabs** - always have content
